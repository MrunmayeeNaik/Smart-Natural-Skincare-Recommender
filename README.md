# Smart-Natural-Skincare-Recommender
Welcome to Skincare Remedy Recommender â€” a machine learning-based project that helps users discover natural skincare remedies based on home-available ingredients like turmeric, honey, aloe vera, and more.

This project uses a simple rule-based filtering system to suggest suitable remedies based on selected ingredients. Future versions aim to incorporate intelligent recommendations using NLP, skin concern filtering, and potentially a trained ML model.
